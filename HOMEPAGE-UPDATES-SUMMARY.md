## What Changed

### 1. Hero Section
- **Before:** "Trace illicit funds. Build evidence-grade cases."
- **After:** "Follow the funds. Build defensible cases."
- **Subheading:** Now explicitly names the problem (slow, fragmented investigations) and the three key audiences (investigators, compliance teams, regulators)
- **Pill badge:** Changed from "Trusted by Law Enforcement Worldwide" to "Blockchain Intelligence Platform" (avoids unverifiable claim)

### 2. Section Labels (Sidebar markers)
Updated to reflect investigative workflow rather than generic feature categories:
- "TRUSTED BY" → "WHO WE SERVE"
- "CAPABILITIES" → "INVESTIGATION WORKFLOW"
- "MOBILE" → "FIELD OPERATIONS"
- "SCALE" → "ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE"
- "FAQ" → "SECURITY & PROCUREMENT"

### 3. Capabilities Section
- **Before:** "Purpose-built for financial crime investigators"
- **After:** "From alert to evidence, in a single workspace"
- Now frames capabilities as a workflow (ingest → explore → assess → export) rather than a flat feature list
- Card titles updated:
  - "Graph-Based Investigation" → "Visual Transaction Tracing"
  - "Evidence-Grade Reporting" → "Court-Ready Documentation"
- Copy emphasises outcomes (explaining paths to prosecutors, meeting evidentiary standards)

### 4. Mobile Section
- **Before:** "Mobile App for in the field scanning"
- **After:** "Investigate anywhere with mobile-first tooling"
- Copy now emphasises real-world use cases: interviews, crime scenes, field work
- Added detail about syncing findings back to case workspace

### 5. Scale/Infrastructure Section
- **Before:** "Enterprise-grade infrastructure for mission-critical investigations"
- **After:** "Built for speed, security, and regulatory scrutiny"
- Copy now emphasises what matters to buyers: sub-second alerts, audit trails, security standards

### 6. FAQ Section
- **Before:** "Questions from procurement and security teams"
- **After:** "Questions from security and procurement"
- Intro copy refined to acknowledge that onboarding requires rigour

### 7. CTA Section
- **Before:** "Ready to strengthen your crypto investigation capabilities?"
- **After:** "See ShadowTrace in action."

### 8. Global Navigation (Top Nav)

### 10. Footer Navigation
- "Platform" group renamed to "Product"

## Why These Changes Improve Clarity

1. **Problem-first messaging:** The hero now immediately articulates the pain point (slow, fragmented, hard-to-document investigations) before introducing the solution.

2. **Audience segmentation:** Explicitly naming investigators, compliance teams, and regulators helps visitors self-identify and understand relevance.

3. **Workflow framing:** Presenting capabilities as an investigative lifecycle (ingest → trace → assess → report) aligns with how practitioners think about their work.

4. **Outcome emphasis:** Copy now focuses on what users achieve (defensible cases, explainable paths, court-ready documentation) rather than technical features.

5. **Clearer CTAs:** "Request Demo" is now visible in top nav for enterprise buyers who know what they want. "Sign In" remains accessible but secondary.

6. **Procurement-friendly language:** Section labels and copy acknowledge the procurement reality (security scrutiny, vendor assessments, audit requirements).

## Assumptions Made

1. **No fabricated claims:** Avoided specific customer counts, accuracy percentages, or endorsement claims that cannot be independently verified.

2. **Existing page routes:** All navigation links point to existing pages (platform.html, solutions.html, pricing.html, resources.html, contact.html, login.html, about.html).

3. **Testimonial content unchanged:** The testimonial carousel content was not modified as it already uses anonymised institutional references (e.g., "National Law Enforcement Unit, EMEA Region").

4. **UK English maintained:** All copy uses UK spelling conventions (organisation, defence, rigour, etc.).

5. **No layout changes:** All updates are copy-only; component structure, CSS classes, and visual layout remain unchanged.
