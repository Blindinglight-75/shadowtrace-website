# ShadowTrace Brand Voice Guide

## Overview

This guide defines the voice, tone, and messaging principles for all ShadowTrace communications. It ensures consistency across the website, marketing materials, product copy, and customer communications.

---

## Brand Positioning

**One-line positioning:**
ShadowTrace is a blockchain intelligence platform that helps investigators trace illicit funds and compliance teams manage crypto risk.

**Target audiences:**
1. Law enforcement agencies (financial crime units, cybercrime teams)
2. Financial institutions (AML/compliance teams, fraud investigators)
3. Crypto exchanges and VASPs (compliance officers, risk teams)
4. Regulators (supervisory bodies, enforcement divisions)

**Key differentiators:**
- Investigation-first UX (graph investigations, case workspaces, audit trails)
- Real-time monitoring and alerts
- Explainable risk scoring (show the reasoning, not just a number)
- Evidence-grade reporting (court-ready documentation)
- API-first architecture for integration

## Voice Characteristics

### Authoritative
We know blockchain forensics. We speak with confidence about technical concepts without being condescending. We don't hedge unnecessarily.

**Do:** "ShadowTrace traces funds across 15 blockchains with sub-second latency."
**Don't:** "ShadowTrace might be able to help you trace funds across various blockchains."

### Direct
Get to the point. Our audience is busy. They want to know what the product does and whether it solves their problem.

**Do:** "Trace funds. Build cases. Catch criminals."
**Don't:** "In today's ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies, the need for comprehensive solutions has never been greater."

### Professional
Our customers work in serious environments: law enforcement, financial regulation, compliance. The tone should match.

**Do:** "Generate court-ready evidence packages."
**Don't:** "Crush it with awesome reports!"

### Modern
We're a technology company. The language should feel current, not stuffy or overly corporate.

**Do:** "Real-time alerts when monitored addresses transact."
**Don't:** "Receive notifications pertaining to activity on addresses under surveillance."

## Language Conventions

### Spelling & Grammar
- **UK English** throughout (organisation, colour, behaviour, etc.)
- Use the Oxford comma: "law enforcement, regulators, and financial institutions"
- Sentence case for headings: "How it works" not "How It Works"

### Technical Terms
- "Blockchain" not "block chain" or "block-chain"
- "Cryptocurrency" or "crypto" (both acceptable)
- "Wallet address" or simply "address"
- "Transaction hash" or "tx hash"
- "Entity" for a cluster of addresses belonging to one actor

### Product Terminology
- "Graph investigation" (visual exploration of transaction flows)
- "Case workspace" (collaborative investigation environment)
- "Risk score" (always explain it's based on observable factors)
- "Alert" (real-time notification of activity)
- "Evidence package" (exportable report for legal proceedings)

### Avoid
- "Revolutionary" / "groundbreaking" / "cutting-edge" (overused, unverifiable)
- "Best-in-class" / "world-leading" / "industry-leading" (unverifiable claims)
- "Leverage" as a verb (use "use" instead)
- "Utilise" (use "use")
- "Solution" as a standalone noun (what problem does it solve?)
- "Synergy" / "paradigm" / "ecosystem" (corporate jargon)
- Exclamation marks in product copy

## CTAs (Calls to Action)

## What We Don't Say

### No Unverifiable Claims

- Don't use superlatives without evidence

### No Fear-Mongering
- We highlight risks without being alarmist
- We don't exaggerate threats to sell

### No Legal Advice
- We provide tools, not legal guidance
- "Consult your legal team" for compliance-specific questions

### No Fabricated Social Proof
- No invented testimonials or logos without permission
- Use role/organisation type if specific attribution isn't available
  - "Head of Compliance, UK-based Exchange" ✓
  - "John Smith, CEO of BigBank" ✗ (unless verified)
